javascript through out interaction with html by dom 

remote control is dom

allows us interact with html
dom is mediator 
translator is javascript and html 

internally its object of html


id always be unique


internally its look like object dom will convert it into dom 

innerText
innerHtml both are same given output but silde differnt be there

without html we can not target on them 


class is give us return as array 

even can get index based also here 
class[0];

we can print as data here in for loop

class means multiple classes we can give same name

tag name also we can give here document.getElementbytagName

accumulated form of array all the tagname

we can get it all the array in the for loop

query selector matches with a css selector 

queryselectorAll - in the form of array will give us 


query selector will gives only one element


improvised we are usong event handler it will take two argument 

first arg will take it event name we will not using name on term instead for onclick for only click 

second arg is function u have to declare just give the name of function how many time u have click on that submit button then it will shows number of times in console


any function u can write in the pass as argument like arraow function and anonymous function normal function also we can do it but we can call directly here 

in addeventListener u must be declare only 
 execute only one function

 u can store thevalue into the variable then u can take ref as call the method add event listener 

 directly we can call it in one line


hof we can write the logic here

mouseenter 

multiple events we can write here

you can not use outside div in the inside div 


if have div and container then target is all then #container>div 

boxes is array right so we can get the method in forEach()in the method we can pass function

every addevent listener need to be trigger then go for the another function in the second argument

event.target.innerText


eval()-it will calculate given us result
